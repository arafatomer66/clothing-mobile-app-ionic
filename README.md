# Ionic Ecommerce Clothing App

Strictly to be used for only education purpose and not otherwise. <br>
The app was developed using ionic 3. For backend, java was used along with spring boot, hibernate with elastic search. Unfortunately I can't provide you with the backend file. API design is pretty simple and easy to understand. Feel free to contact me for any assistance.

### Getting Started

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start application:

```
> git clone https://github.com/manjillama/clothing-mobile-app-ionic.git
> cd IonicClothingApp
> npm install
> ionic serve
```

You would need to install ionic cli if not already present. Pretty simple! enjoy.
